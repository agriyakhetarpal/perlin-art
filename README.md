# perlin-art
Create animated artwork with Perlin noise procedural generation via the p5.js <code>[noise()](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/noise)</code> function(s). The only dependency is the p5.js library, which has been provided locally but can be used from a [CDN service](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/p5.js) as well.
