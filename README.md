# perlin-art
Create animated artwork with Perlin noise procedural generation via the p5.js `noise()` function(s). The only dependency is the p5.js library, which is provided locally but can be used from a [CDN service](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/p5.js) as well.

## How to run

1. Clone the repository via (or make your own fork!)
```
git clone https://github.com/agriyakhetarpal/perlin-art.git
```
  
 2. Open `index.html` in a WebAssembly-compliant browser to use WebGL. It is preferred to use [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) if you use Visual Studio Code.
